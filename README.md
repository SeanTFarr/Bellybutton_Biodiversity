## Overview of Project
-----------------
Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots, but is that the only place to find a source of bacteria? This question prompted a biological reasearcher to look into the possibility of finding a useful bacteria on the human body. To test this hypothesis, samples were taken from the navels of people across the nation to identify bacterial species that live in our belly buttons. An ID number was assigned to the test subjects  to allow them to stay anonymous. This dashboard was created using JavaScipt to read and parse through a JSON data file to ultimately display the data to both the participants and the researchers.
